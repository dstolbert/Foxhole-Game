# Foxhole-Game

Consider five holes in a line. One of them is occupied by a fox. Each night, the fox moves to a neighboring hole, either to the left or to the right. Each morning, you get to inspect a hole of your choice. What strategy would ensure that the fox is eventually caught?

Run the file for a console version of the challenge above. Once complete you can see how many it took you to complete the problem and what the inputs you used to do so. Additionally, you will be selected to choose how many holes you want to include when you start the game.
